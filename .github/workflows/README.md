# CWS Continuous Integration (CI) Pipeline

The following workflows establish continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines for this repository containing the open-source release of the [NASA-AMMOS](https://ammos.nasa.gov/) Common Workflow Service (CWS).

Utilizing GitHub Actions, the workflows build, test, and deliver CWS by configuring steps required to accomplish these tasks, making use of Marketplace Actions in the process. There are currently two CI pipelines: [CWS CI Camunda](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/common-workflow-service/actions/workflows/camunda.yml) and [CWS CI LDAP](https://github.com/NASA-AMMOS/common-workflow-service/actions/workflows/ldap.yml).

## CWS CI Camunda Workflow

The CWS CI Camunda workflow is triggered upon any push to the repository, including commits, pull requests, and merges. The workflow is also scheduled to run every Monday at 5 AM PST / 12 PM UTC. It is composed of three jobs: `build-and-test-cws`, `advanced-test`, and `publish-cws-image`. All jobs run on separate GitHub runners with the latest version of Ubuntu.

The `build-and-test-cws` job performs all the necessary preliminary steps required to configure and build CWS with Camunda security. Once these steps are completed, a fully-functioning instance of CWS is built. Following the build, unit and integration tests are run, with resulting artifacts being saved to the workflow run. Afterwards, data from the workflow is sent to the development team.

The `advanced-test` job is fundamentally the same for the build of CWS, except 2 workers being started instead of 1. Following the build, an advanced integration test requiring additional workers is run.

The `publish-cws-image` job is the CD component of the workflow, triggered upon a commit with a tag and dependant upon successful completion of the `build-and-test-cws` and `advanced-test` jobs.

> **Note**
> The current GitHub runner configuration used for the build and test of CWS, as well as the advanced test, supports up to 1 console and 2 workers.
> More than 2 workers may result in test failures due to the stress on the runner.

## CWS CI LDAP Workflow

The CWS CI LDAP workflow is triggered upon any push to the repository, including commits, pull requests, and merges. The workflow is also scheduled to run every Monday at 5 AM PST / 12 PM UTC. It is composed of one job, `build-and-test-cws`, and runs on a GitHub runner with the latest version of Ubuntu.

The `build-and-test-cws` job performs all the necessary preliminary steps required to configure and build CWS with LDAP security. Once these steps are completed, a fully-functioning instance of CWS is built. Following the build, LDAP-specific integration tests are run. Afterwards, data from the workflow is sent to the development team.

The following are key differences in the steps of the `build-and-test-cws` job between the `CWS CI Camunda` and `CWS CI LDAP` workflows.

> **Note**
> The current GitHub runner configuration used for the build and test of CWS supports up to 1 console and 2 workers.
> More than 2 workers may result in test failures due to the stress on the runner.
